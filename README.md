**Rules**

The game principles are fairly easy to grasp:

1. Every player is positionned randomly on the map during the `lobby`.
2. When the `game` starts, each player must take down others (either in death match, or team death match).
3. There are some `potions` on the map that restore health.
4. The last player (or team) alive wins 🎉.

You can see a very small amount of gameplay below (the framerate of this GIF is low):
